## Project Overview

Icarus is a high-performance file uploader that leverages the power of Rust, WebAssembly (WASM), Node.js, and React to provide a seamless and efficient file uploading experience. By combining Rust's performance with WASM's browser capabilities, Node.js server, and React's user interface, Icarus offers a unique solution for handling file uploads in web applications.

## Technologies Used

- **Rust**: Core logic and performance-critical operations
- **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Browser-side execution of Rust code
- **Node.js**: Server-side operations and API handling
- **React**: User interface and component management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling and responsive design
- **webpack**: Module bundling and development server
- **wasm-pack**: Tool for building Rust-generated WebAssembly
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js

```

## Setup and Installation

1. Install Rust:
   ```
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Install wasm-pack:
   ```
   cargo install wasm-pack
   ```

3. Install Node.js and npm: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

4. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd icarus
   ```

5. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cargo build
   cd www && npm install
   cd client && npm install
   ```

6. Build the WebAssembly module:
   ```
   wasm-pack build
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Start the server and client concurrently:
   ```
   cd www
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`

3. For production build:
   ```
   cd www
   npm run build
   ```

## Key Features

- High-performance file processing using Rust and WASM
- Server-side handling with Node.js and Express
- Responsive and intuitive UI with React and Tailwind CSS
- Real-time updates using WebSockets
- Efficient handling of large files
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Areas for Improvement

1. Implement more robust error handling in Rust, Node.js, and React components
2. Expand the range of supported file types and implement specific handling for each
3. Add real-time progress tracking for file uploads
4. Implement chunk-based uploading for very large files
5. Enhance security measures, including file validation and sanitization
6. Add capability to queue uploads when offline
7. Implement multi-language support

## Next Steps

1. Implement Core Rust Functionality
   - File: `src/lib.rs`
   - Action: Implement basic file processing functions

2. Create React File Uploader Component
   - File: `www/client/src/components/FileUploader.js`
   - Action: Implement the UI for file uploading

3. Integrate WASM with React
   - Update `www/client/src/App.js` to use the WASM module

4. Implement File Upload API
   - Enhance `www/server/server.js` with RESTful endpoints for file upload

5. Add Tailwind CSS Styling
   - Update `www/client/src/index.css` with Tailwind imports

6. Implement Testing
   - Add unit tests in Rust (`tests/web.rs`)
   - Add React component tests

7. Enhance Documentation
   - Add inline documentation to Rust, Node.js, and React code
   - Update README with new features and instructions

8. Optimization
   - Profile and optimize Rust code for performance
   - Optimize React rendering and state management
   - Improve Node.js server efficiency
